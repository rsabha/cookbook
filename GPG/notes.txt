1. Key setup
2. Use cases
2.1 file encryption
2.2 signing messages/files
2.3

### Key setup

keys can have the following cabibilities: [C] Cerifty, [S] Sign, [E]
Encrypt, [A] Authenticate

defaultls when generating a keypair, you get Master-Key with cabililty [C]
and an optinal [S]. and an addinal subkey with capibility [E].

for security, you will have mutiple keys, each surving a unique
perose:

1. Master-Key

1.1 will only have the perpose of Certifying newly created Sub-Keys, signaling that
all Sub-Keys was created by the identy behind the Master-Key.

1.2 for best security key should be exported and stored offline, and then
deleted from gpg

1.3 public key contain data of all Sub-Keys

1.4 also keep a safe copy somewhere of the revoke cerificate that
comes with each Master-Key. if you lose access to the Master-Key you
can invalidad your keys and update the keyserver so that everyone
knows.

2. Sub-Key

2.1 For Signing files/messages - verify the file or message was
created and publish by the identy behind the Master-Key

3. Sub-Key

3.1 an Encryption Key for encrypting files or messages.

4. Sub-Key

4.1 an Authentication Key for SSH



key rotation:

each key should have an expiry date set, after which they get deleted
and replaced with newly generated keys. Or cycled when a key was
exposed.

your Master-Key should never be changed, once the public key and
fingerprint of your Master-Key has been confirmed by a friend, they
will use a keyserver to keep track of your newly created Sub-Keys.

after key roration make sure to pushlish the changes to a keyserver,
or other exchange method used for your trust-of-web.

keyserver:

upload your public key of the Master-Key. the public key contains
extra data like all Sub-Key info, name and email, etc.

you should regulary update all public keys of other users you have, by
pulling them from the keyserver.

uid:

name, email and comment. attached to master-public-key
