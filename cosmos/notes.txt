We suggest that the modern expeditions attempting to
reach the moon are mistakenly going to Rahu.

p.286

Outside the ocean of liquor is another islan

He divided it into seven parts

In those seven islands there are seven boundary mountains,

Inhabitants: Kusalas, Kovidas, Ahhiyuktas and Kulakas


Krauncadvipa:

Outside the ocean of clarified butter is another island

  As
Kusadvipa is surrounded by an ocean of clarified butter


Krauncadvipa is surrounded by an ocean of milk as broad as the is­
land itself.


Mount Kraufica:

the
mountain has become fearless because it is always bathed on all
sides by the ocean of milk


He
also divided his own island among his seven sons

and there are also
seven rivers

Therefore you purify the three planetary

## Sakadvipa

Outside the ocean of milk is another island, Sakadvipa

As
Krauiicadvipa is surrounded by its own ocean of milk, Sakadvipa is
surrounded by an ocean of churned yogurt as broad as the island

He also divided his island into seven sec­
tions,

whom he made the kings of that island.

## Puskaradvipa:

on Pu�karadvipa there is a great lotus flower with 1 00,000,000 pure
golden petals, as effulgent as the flames of fire


In the middle of that island is a great mountain named Manasot­
tara, which forms the boundary between the inner side and the
outer side of the island.

Its breadth and height are 10,000 yojanas
[80,000 miles] . On that mountain, in the four directions, are the
residential quarters of demigods such as lndra. In the chariot of
the sun-god, the sun travels on the top of the mountain in an orbit
called the Sarilvatsara, encircling Mount Meru. The sun's path on
the northern side is called Uttaray�a, and its path on the southern
side is called Dak�il).ayana. One side represents a day for the
demigods, and the other represents their night.

The movement of the sun is confirmed i n the Brahma-sarhhita (5.52) :
yasyajfiiiya bhramati sarhbhrta-kala-cakra}:t,. The sun orbits around
Mou nt Sumeru, for six months on the northern side and for six months
on the southern. This adds up to the duration of a day and night of the
demigods in the upper planetary systems.

The ruler of this island, the son of Maharaja Priyavrata named
Vitihotra, had two sons named Ram�aka and Dhataki. He granted
the two sides of the island to these two sons and then personally
engaged himself in activities for the sake of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead like his elder brother Medhatithi.

Thereafter, beyond the ocean of sweet water and fully sur­
rounding it, is a mountain named Lokaloka, which divides the
countries that are full of sunlight from those not lit by the sun.

Beyond the ocean of sweet water is a tract of land as broad as the
area between the middle of Mount Sumeru and the boundary of
Manasottara Mountain.

In that tract of land there are many living
beings. Beyond it, extending to Lokaloka Mountain, is another
land, which is made of gold. Because of its golden surface, it
reflects light like the surface of a mirror, and any physical article
that falls on that land can never be perceived again. All living
entities, therefore, have abandoned that golden land.


Lokaloka: border of the three worlds - Bhiirloka, Bhuvarloka and Svarloka


three primary planetary
systems - Bhuh, Bhuvah and Svah
-into which the universe is divided

distance
between Sumeru and the mountain known as Lokaloka is one
fourth of the diameter of the universe -or, in other words,
125,000,000 yojanas [I billion miles] .


The sun is situated (vertically] in the middle of the universe, in
the area between Bhiirloka and Bhuvarloka

which is called an­
tarik�a, outer space

The distance between the sun and the circum­
ference of the universe is twenty-five koti yojanas (two billion
miles].

The word koti means ten million, and a yojana is eight miles. The
diameter of the universe is fifty koti yojanas (four billion miles) .
Therefore, since the sun is in the middle of the universe, the distance
between the sun and the edge of the universe is calculated to be twenty­
five koti yojanas (two billion miles) .


----

The sky between the earthly sphere and heavenly sphere is called
antarik�a, or outer space. It adjoins the top of the sphere of earth
and the bottom of that of heaven.
